Syncing progress between the three is not automatic, and I end up revising words I already revised multiple times, that leads to progress stagnation and I\u0026rsquo;m better off first finishing WaniKani, then Anki.\nThanks for reading, see you at the next language-learning check-in!

It defines the point where our perception of physics and reality no longer follow their usual laws, the point of no return, where nothing—not even light—can escape.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s dive into one of my favorite topics when it comes to black holes!\nWhat Is the Schwarzschild Radius? The Schwarzschild radius is the radius from the center of mass where the escape velocity of an object equals the speed of light (~1,079,252,848.8 km/h!). This means nothing can escape it. Any object crossing this radius is lost to the black hole, as no information or matter can escape its grip.\nThe Schwarzschild radius of Earth—if we were to condense it into a black hole—would be 8.87 millimeters, showing how dense the object has to be.\nThe Math Behind It To calculate the Schwarzschild radius, we start with the escape velocity formula:\n$$ v_e = \\sqrt{\\frac{2GM}{r}} $$\nHere:\n$v_e$: Escape velocity $\\left(\\frac{\\text{m}}{\\text{s}}\\right)$, $G$: Gravitational constant $\\left(\\approx 6.674 \\times 10^{-11} \\frac{\\text{m}^3}{\\text{kg} \\cdot \\text{s}^2}\\right)$, $M$: Mass of the object (kg), $r$: Distance from the center (m). Velocity equals the speed of light $c$ ($ \\approx 3 \\times 10^8$ m/s). Substituting $v_e = c$ and solving for $r$:\n$$ R_s = \\frac{2GM}{c^2} $$\nThe Schwarzschild radius depends only on the mass $M$ of the object, showing that even a small object can theoretically have a Schwarzschild radius if compressed enough.\nImplications and Observations Even more than being a curious constant, it marks the event horizon, which is the beyond where physics and reality warp beyond our current understanding. Since general relativity tells us that spacetime can curve infinitely, nothing will ever escape a black hole.\nThe observation of an object near a black hole is not fully understood, but we understand that the obejct will never fully enter the black hole from out perspective, but appear to slow down, and even stay still before the event horizon.\nThe next time you look up, try thinking about how much cool stuff is out there - both literally and mathematically!\n","permalink":"https://tmukh.github.io/posts/astrophysics/schwarzschild-radius/","summary":"\u003ch2 id=\"the-schwarzschild-radius-the-black-hole-warning-sign\"\u003eThe Schwarzschild Radius, the black hole warning sign\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Schwarzschild radius—named after \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Schwarzschild\"\u003eKarl Schwarzschild\u003c/a\u003e—is a cornerstone in Einstein\u0026rsquo;s general theory of relativity.

I don\u0026rsquo;t know.. 4-5 months? I\u0026rsquo;ll be doing an update once a week, reviewing my Anki card progress, that is, how many cards I know and how much my vocabulary has grown, alongside my WaniKani Progress, which is my Kanji learning method.\nWell then.. 行こう!\nFor starters, I am currently on level 4 on WaniKani, which will cover about 30% of the vocab found on sites such as NHK Easy which have simplified Japanese news articles, aimed at aiding those still learning Japanese.\nWhat do the level in WaniKani mean? WaniKani has split Kanji groups into different levels, ranked per difficulty, frequency, and scenarios.\nI am aiming for around 90% comprehension, for a first milestone, which is around level 24, so on average, that will take 25-30 weeks.\nThe levels also cover the amount of Kanji needed for each of the JLPT levels. The following is how much the first 27 levels cover\nWhere am I at? Anki Progress My current status in Anki shows that I have about 300 words learned/in progress, out of 11,000ish. That is still a ways way away, but I firmly believe I can get this number within 1-2 years.\nA mature word is one I\u0026rsquo;ve gotten right a lot, and is basically \u0026ldquo;memorized\u0026rdquo;, learning words are ones I\u0026rsquo;ve reviewed within the past week or two, which aren\u0026rsquo;t matured yet.\nWaniKani Progress As mentioned, I am currently on level 4 on WaniKani with 89 Kanjis learned and 173 words. Seems like my retention rate is floating around 90% which is not too bad (for my memory standards)\nFinal remarks I think it\u0026rsquo;s important to enjoy the game-ification aspect of WaniKani, but to remember not to speed through it. The faster you try to learn the words, without reviewing the previous ones correctly , the more words will stack up for reviewing. even now I\u0026rsquo;m at 100 reviews per day! Imagine once I reach level 20-30, those might be up to 1000 reviews if I don\u0026rsquo;t consistently review and review correctly\nThanks for reading, see you at the next language-learning check-in!

This year is different, I will try my absolute hardest in order to reach a level I am satisfied with.\nWell.. where do we start?\nMethodology I\u0026rsquo;ll be using the Refold method, which mainly focuses on immersion.\nWhat is immersion? Immersion is a technique in which you consume media in your target language.\nThe key here is that this input should be just above your skill (This is a highly debated topic! Some people say it can be any level)\nImmersing media can be anything from Music, TV shows, Movies, Podcasts, Books, and so on..\nSo, how does the roadmap look like? The refold method puts big emphasis on immersion, but also vocabulary. Grammar is also important of course, but thought of as a lesser goal, due to native speakers picking it up naturally\n💡 Think about it, how did you learn the Grammar of your Native language, or even english? I personally picked it up naturally through watching thousands and thousand of hours of TV/Videos The point is that Grammar, while learnable from books, is something you get used to over time.\nStep 1: Acquire Vocabulary This will have an entire blog post on it\u0026rsquo;s own, but according to Zipf\u0026rsquo;s there\u0026rsquo;s a set number of words that are used in 95% of the language. For most languages that peaks around 3-5 thousand words (For english it\u0026rsquo;s 2000 words for 90% of speech).\nℹ️ Research shows that the most frequent:\n1,000 words cover ~75% of daily conversation 2,200 words cover ~90% of general content 3,500 words reach ~95% comprehension 5,000 words give you ~98% coverage How do I learn vocabulary? However you like! There are methods loved by language learners, such as Anki which give you daily reviews of already learned vocab, and give you 10-20 new words per day to learn, which means you\u0026rsquo;ll learn 5000 words in just about 2 years.\nNow 5000 words is nowhere near enough to understand native content (that is more like 15-25k words) without help, but we can understand most things with a little help!\nStep 2: Immerse, Immerse, Immerse The Moe Way is loved by many and has extensive Anki setup guides and immersing techniques.\nImmersing is a very subjective aspect, if you like anime, then watch anime. If you like music, then download all the J-POP you like! If you\u0026rsquo;re into J-Dramas, then watch those!\nJust remember that you have to somewhat understand the input at least slightly, or if it\u0026rsquo;s too high level it\u0026rsquo;s a good time to start getting used to how the language sounds, to be able to follow it.\nStep 3: Learn Grammar for every few milestones I would personally learn Grammar, and then learn a Grammar point I encounter that I don\u0026rsquo;t know. There are sites such as BunPro that let you choose different grammar sources!\nMy Personal Goals for 2025 Q1 (January - March)\nMaster first 1,000 core vocabulary words Complete basic grammar (N5 level) Daily immersion: 1 hour minimum Q2 (April - June)\nReach 2,000 vocabulary words Start reading simple manga with furigana Increase immersion to 2 hours daily Q3 (July - September)\nBuild vocabulary to 3,000 words Begin consuming media (anime, youtube videos, music) without subtitles Finish Tae Kim\u0026rsquo;s Japanese Grammar Guide Q4 (October - December)\nReach 4,000 vocabulary words Attempt N4 JLPT exam Regular conversation practice ⚠️ Remember: These goals are ambitious! I am a student with a LOT of free time, so if the timeframe for you looks different, do not disparage! Tools I\u0026rsquo;ll Be Using Anki\nCore 2k/6k deck for vocabulary Review time: 30 minutes daily Immersion Sources\nNetflix Japanese content (Double subtitles) YouTube channels (recommend some good ones?) NHK Easy News Japanese podcasts for beginners (Hello Japan is a good one :-) ) Grammar Resources\nTae Kim\u0026rsquo;s Grammar Guide Japanese From Zero series WaniKani\nAmazing resource for learning Kanji Free for the first month, then 9$/month Helps build your vocabulary as well as kanji recognition via mnemonics Progress Tracking I\u0026rsquo;ll be posting a few times a month with the following:\nNumber of words learned (tracked through Anki) Hours of immersion Comprehension improvements (How much of a setnence do i understand on my own?)
