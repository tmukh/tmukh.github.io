This year is different, I will try my absolute hardest in order to reach a level I am satisfied with.\nWell.. where do we start?\nMethodology I’ll be using the Refold method, which mainly focuses on immersion.\nWhat is immersion? Immersion is a technique in which you consume media in your target language.\nThe key here is that this input should be just above your skill (This is a highly debated topic! Some people say it can be any level)\nImmersing media can be anything from Music, TV shows, Movies, Podcasts, Books, and so on..\nSo, how does the roadmap look like? The refold method puts big emphasis on immersion, but also vocabulary. Grammar is also important of course, but thought of as a lesser goal, due to native speakers picking it up naturally\n💡 Think about it, how did you learn the Grammar of your Native language, or even english? I personally picked it up naturally through watching thousands and thousand of hours of TV/Videos The point is that Grammar, while learnable from books, is something you get used to over time.\nStep 1: Acquire Vocabulary This will have an entire blog post on it’s own, but according to Zipf’s there’s a set number of words that are used in 95% of the language. For most languages that peaks around 3-5 thousand words (For english it’s 2000 words for 90% of speech).\nℹ️ Research shows that the most frequent:\n1,000 words cover ~75% of daily conversation 2,200 words cover ~90% of general content 3,500 words reach ~95% comprehension 5,000 words give you ~98% coverage How do I learn vocabulary? However you like! There are methods loved by language learners, such as Anki which give you daily reviews of already learned vocab, and give you 10-20 new words per day to learn, which means you’ll learn 5000 words in just about 2 years.\nNow 5000 words is nowhere near enough to understand native content (that is more like 15-25k words) without help, but we can understand most things with a little help!\nStep 2: Immerse, Immerse, Immerse The Moe Way is loved by many and has extensive Anki setup guides and immersing techniques.\nImmersing is a very subjective aspect, if you like anime, then watch anime. If you like music, then download all the J-POP you like! If you’re into J-Dramas, then watch those!\nJust remember that you have to somewhat understand the input at least slightly, or if it’s too high level it’s a good time to start getting used to how the language sounds, to be able to follow it.\nStep 3: Learn Grammar for every few milestones I would personally learn Grammar, and then learn a Grammar point I encounter that I don’t know. There are sites such as BunPro that let you choose different grammar sources!\nMy Personal Goals for 2025 Q1 (January - March)\nMaster first 1,000 core vocabulary words Complete basic grammar (N5 level) Daily immersion: 1 hour minimum Q2 (April - June)\nReach 2,000 vocabulary words Start reading simple manga with furigana Increase immersion to 2 hours daily Q3 (July - September)\nBuild vocabulary to 3,000 words Begin consuming media (anime, youtube videos, music) without subtitles Finish Tae Kim’s Japanese Grammar Guide Q4 (October - December)\nReach 4,000 vocabulary words Attempt N4 JLPT exam Regular conversation practice ⚠️ Remember: These goals are ambitious! I am a student with a LOT of free time, so if the timeframe for you looks different, do not disparage! Tools I’ll Be Using Anki\nCore 2k/6k deck for vocabulary Review time: 30 minutes daily Immersion Sources\nNetflix Japanese content (Double subtitles) YouTube channels (recommend some good ones?) NHK Easy News Japanese podcasts for beginners (Hello Japan is a good one :-) ) Grammar Resources\nTae Kim’s Grammar Guide Japanese From Zero series WaniKani\nAmazing resource for learning Kanji Free for the first month, then 9$/month Helps build your vocabulary as well as kanji recognition via mnemonics Progress Tracking I’ll be posting a few times a month with the following:\nNumber of words learned (tracked through Anki) Hours of immersion Comprehension improvements (How much of a setnence do i understand on my own?) Challenges faced (Will need an entire blog for that to be honest x.x ) Resources discovered Next Steps In my next post, I’ll dive deeper into setting up an effective Anki system and share my favorite immersion resources.
